### Hi everyone ğŸ˜„ğŸ‘‹

My name is Martin Aiscar and I am an Industrial Engineer student from the Universidad TecnolÃ³gica Nacional Buenos Aires. In 2022, I did a course of Data Science and I really enjoyed it, so I started to study about that. I am currently learning about Data Analytics and Visualization using SQL and Python. I am planning to improve my knowledge and skills related to Machine Learning and Computational statistics.

Below this description, you will see allÂ myÂ projectsÂ
