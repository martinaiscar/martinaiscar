### Hi everyone ðŸ˜„ðŸ‘‹

My name is Martin Aiscar and I am an Industrial Engineer student from the Universidad TecnolÃ³gica Nacional Buenos Aires. In 2022, I did a course about Data Science and I really enjoyed it, so I started to study about thtat. Actually, I am learning about Data Analytics and Visualization with SQL and Python. In near future, I would like to improve my knowledge about Machine Learning and Computational statistics

Below this description, you will see all my projects that I did ðŸ˜„
